Segment your audience – Define whether they are beginners, intermediates, or experts.
Adjust complexity – Use technical terms for experts, plain language for others.

## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
 User surveys & feedback forms – Ask about their tech background.
Monitor support queries – Frequent questions signal areas that need simplification.

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
Use analogies – Compare new concepts to familiar real-world ideas.
Break down steps – Provide step-by-step instructions.
Use visuals – Diagrams, screenshots, and videos improve clarity.

## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?
It improves understanding of all users and reduces confusion.

Techinal term deploy can be replaced with a simple term launch.
Techinal term execute can be replaced with a simple term run.

## 7. How can using examples and visuals help in explaining complex concepts more clearly?
Diagrams show relationships between concepts.
Videos demonstrate real-time actions.
